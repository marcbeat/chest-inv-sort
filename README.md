# chestInvSort
## Chest and Inventory Sorting [Client/Server]

This mod lets you sort your blocks and items in chests and player inventory. Simply press your configured key when your player inventory is openend or when you are interacting with a chest (opened chest menu).
The items will be sorted by type (block > item) first, then by name (A > Z).

By default, the key `y` and the middle mouse button sort the items.

This mod needs to be present on client and server.
### Customization
You can specify which button on your keyboard you assign to sorting your items.
Change the desired key to the config file `.minecraft` -> `config` -> `chestinvsort-client.toml`
The middle mouse button cannot be remapped.
