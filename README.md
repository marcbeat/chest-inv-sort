# ChestInvSort
## Chest and Inventory Sorting [Client/Server]

This mod lets you sort your blocks and items in chests and player inventory. Simply press your configured key when your player inventory is opened or when you are interacting with a chest (opened chest menu).
The items will be sorted by type (block > item) first, then by name (A > Z).

By default, the middle mouse button sorts the items. 

This mod needs to be present on client and server.

### Customization

You can specify which button on your keyboard or mouse you assign to sorting your items.

Change this in your settings under `Options`->`Controls`->`Key binds`->`ChestInvSort Mod`.
